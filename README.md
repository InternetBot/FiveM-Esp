##  Legal & Ethical Notice

This project was created **strictly for educational and research purposes** as part of my personal learning journey in **game security and anti-cheat development**.

The goal of this repository is to understand how cheats and exploits work at a technical level so that better **detection, prevention, and defensive systems** can be built. This is a common and legitimate practice in cybersecurity and game security research.

### Restrictions

- **Do not redistribute** this project or any part of it  
- **Do not use** this project on public or live servers  
- **Do not use** this project to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt gameplay  
- **Do not deploy** this project in any environment without explicit permission

The author is **not responsible** for any damage, bans, losses, or legal issues that may result from misuse of this software.  
By accessing or using this project, you agree that you are solely responsible for how it is used.

### Research Purpose

This project exists to:
- Study how cheats interact with game memory and engines  
- Understand common exploit techniques  
- Learn how anti-cheat systems detect and stop them  
- Build skills toward becoming a **game security / anti-cheat developer**

If you are interested in offensive security, reverse engineering, or anti-cheat development, this project is intended as a **learning reference only** — not a tool for exploitation.
